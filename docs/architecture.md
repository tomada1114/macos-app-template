```

The dependency direction is strictly one-way: `MyAppCore` ← `MyAppUI` and
`MyAppCore` ← `MyAppPlatform`, and both ← `App`.

`MyAppCore` must stay free of UI frameworks so it also serves an iOS target
(`docs/adding-ios.md`). SwiftPM's target graph cannot stop `import SwiftUI` — a system
framework is not a package dependency — so the boundary is enforced twice, by text
match: `.swiftlint.yml`'s `no_ui_import_in_core` custom rule (the pre-commit hook,
`just lint`, CI's `lint` job) and the `ArchitectureBoundaryTests` suite in
`MyAppCoreTests` (`just test`, CI's `test` job). Both reject the UI frameworks
`SwiftUI`, `AppKit`, `UIKit`, and `Cocoa` (which re-exports AppKit), and the
OS-integration frameworks an adapter reaches for first — `ApplicationServices`
(accessibility), `Carbon` (hotkeys), and `ServiceManagement` (login items) — including
attributed
(`@preconcurrency import AppKit`) and kind-qualified (`import struct SwiftUI.Color`)
imports. A `//`-commented import is ignored, but one that starts a line inside a
`/* … */` block or a multi-line string literal is still flagged — delete it instead.
"Platform-agnostic" here means free of those frameworks, not buildable on Linux:
Apple-only frameworks such as Combine stay allowed, and so does Foundation — and so do
`os` and `OSLog`, deliberately, so Core can log (see Logging below).

## Ports and adapters

Code that talks to the OS — `NSWorkspace`, accessibility, a Carbon hotkey, an event tap,
an `NSPanel` overlay, a login item — lives in `MyAppPlatform`, never in Core, a view, or
the shell. It is always the same three pieces, and the template ships one worked example
of them to copy:

1. **The port**, in Core — a `Sendable` protocol taking and returning value types Core
   owns: `FrontmostAppProviding` in
   `Packages/MyAppKit/Sources/MyAppCore/FrontmostAppProviding.swift`.
2. **The adapter**, in Platform — the OS framework import, translating the OS type into
   the Core value and doing nothing else: `WorkspaceFrontmostAppProvider` in
   `Packages/MyAppKit/Sources/MyAppPlatform/WorkspaceFrontmostAppProvider.swift`.
3. **The fake**, in the test target — a real implementation answering from data the test
   hands it, used by the Core tests of whatever consumes the port
   (`.claude/rules/testing.md` › Fakes, not mocks): `FakeFrontmostAppProvider` in
   `Packages/MyAppKit/Tests/MyAppCoreTests/FrontmostAppViewModelTests.swift`.

`App/` is the composition root: the only place that constructs an adapter and hands it
to a Core view model, so nothing below it knows which implementation answered. A test
substitutes the fake at that same seam.

`MyAppPlatform` is deliberately **outside the coverage floor** — `scripts/coverage.sh`
measures `Sources/MyAppCore` only. That is a constraint on adapters rather than a
licence: an adapter carries translation, so it has no branch worth a test. The moment
one needs a decision, the decision moves into Core behind the port, where the floor
sees it.

## Logging

**`MyAppCore` imports `os` directly, and that does not break the boundary.** The ban
list above is UI frameworks and the OS-integration frameworks an adapter reaches for;
`os` is neither. It pulls in no AppKit, it is available on every Apple platform Core is
meant to serve (`docs/adding-ios.md`), and it writes to the unified log rather than
touching the screen or the OS on Core's behalf. So logging is *not* modelled as a port:
a `LoggingPort` would buy no testability — a log line is not an outcome a test asserts —
and would cost every Core type an injected dependency it does not otherwise need. `os`
and `OSLog` are therefore absent from both halves of the ban list, `.swiftlint.yml`'s
`no_ui_import_in_core` and `ArchitectureBoundaryTests`, and a test case pins their
absence so narrowing that list later fails loudly.

Every logger lives in `AppLog` (`Packages/MyAppKit/Sources/MyAppCore/AppLog.swift`), the
one place the subsystem is spelled. It is a literal — the app's bundle identifier — and
not `Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier`, which answers for the test runner under `swift test`
and for the preview agent inside an Xcode preview; `scripts/bootstrap.sh` rewrites the
literal with the same placeholder replacement that rewrites `project.yml`, and
`AppLogTests` fails if the two disagree. `MyAppUI`, `MyAppPlatform`, and `App/` log
through the same loggers, which they already see by importing `MyAppCore`, so one
`just logs` stream shows the whole app.

The conventions that go with it — one category per concern, a privacy annotation on
anything user-derived, and never `print`/`debugPrint`/`NSLog` under `Sources/` or `App/`
(`.swiftlint.yml`'s `no_print_in_sources` rejects them) — are in
`.claude/rules/swift.md` › Logging. `FrontmostAppViewModel.refresh()` is the worked
example: it logs that a refresh happened `.public` and the other application's name
`.private`.

## Where new code goes

| You are adding… | It goes in… | Tested by… |
|---|---|---|
| Domain logic, state, view models | `Packages/MyAppKit/Sources/MyAppCore` | Swift Testing in `Tests/MyAppCoreTests` (coverage-gated) |
| Views, view modifiers | `Packages/MyAppKit/Sources/MyAppUI` | Core view-model tests + the launch UI test |
| OS integration: AppKit, accessibility, hotkeys, login items, the file system beyond Foundation | `Packages/MyAppKit/Sources/MyAppPlatform`, as an adapter behind a Core port | Core tests through a fake of the port (the adapter itself is outside the coverage floor) |
| App lifecycle, scenes, menus, wiring an adapter to a view model | `App/` | `LaunchUITests` + `just smoke` |

That last row carries one decision the table cannot: the app's *shape*. The template
ships a regular windowed app — `WindowGroup`, a Dock tile, a launch test that waits for
a window. A menu-bar agent (`LSUIElement`, `MenuBarExtra`, a launch test that waits for
a status item) changes `project.yml`, `App/MyAppApp.swift`, and
`LaunchUITests/LaunchTests.swift`, and nothing below them.
`.agents/skills/starting-an-app/references/app-shapes.md` gives both shapes as proven
code, including where an `NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor`'s delegate lives when
`MenuBarExtra` is not enough (`MyAppPlatform`, never `App/`).

Keeping logic out of views is what makes the coverage floor honest: the gate
measures the code that can regress silently, not SwiftUI layout. The same reasoning
keeps decisions out of adapters — see "Ports and adapters" above.

## Recommended optional dependencies

The template ships with zero. When a real need appears, these are vetted
starting points.

### For tests and distribution

- [ViewInspector](https://github.com/nalexn/ViewInspector) — unit-test SwiftUI
  view hierarchies when view-model tests stop being enough.
- [swift-snapshot-testing](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing)
  — pixel/structure regression tests for complex custom views.
- [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org/) — in-app updates once you distribute
  outside the App Store and users ask for auto-update (see docs/distribution.md).

### What a utility app reaches for first

Four needs turn up in nearly every hotkey-driven or menu-bar app, and each one's
zero-dependency answer is stated first on purpose. In this layout that answer is an
adapter in `MyAppPlatform` behind a Core port ("Ports and adapters" above) — usually
less code than integrating a package, and it keeps the decision in Core where the
coverage floor sees it. Reach for a package only when the "worth it when" sentence
describes your app.

Every package named below was checked against `.claude/rules/project.md`'s dependency
checklist on **2026-09-21**: license, latest release, whether the repository is
archived, the `platforms:` floor in its `Package.swift`, and whether that manifest
declares a binary target or a build plugin. Re-check before you add one — these facts
go stale, and the checklist's Need, Weight, and Advisories items are still yours to
answer for your app.

**Global hotkeys.** Carbon's `RegisterEventHotKey` is still the supported API for a
system-wide shortcut, and wrapping it costs roughly sixty lines: an adapter in
`MyAppPlatform` that installs one `EventHandlerUPP`, keeps an id→handler dictionary,
and hands Core a `Sendable` port. `Carbon` is one of the frameworks Core may not
import, which is why the adapter is the shape rather than a workaround. A package is
worth it when your users rebind shortcuts in the UI — the recorder control, its
conflict detection against system shortcuts, and persistence are the tedious part, not
the registration.

- [KeyboardShortcuts](https://github.com/sindresorhus/KeyboardShortcuts) — passes:
  MIT; 3.1.0 released 2026-09-11; not archived; floor `.macOS(.v10_15)`, at or below
  this package's `.macOS(.v14)`; one Swift target, no binary target, no build plugin,
  no package dependencies. It ships AppKit and SwiftUI recorder views, so it belongs to
  `MyAppUI` and `MyAppPlatform` — its types must not reach Core.

**Launch at login.** No package. `SMAppService.mainApp.register()` (ServiceManagement,
macOS 13+, below this package's macOS 14 floor) is the entire API, with
`SMAppService.mainApp.status` to read it back; it lives in a `MyAppPlatform` adapter
because `ServiceManagement` is also on Core's blocked-import list. Do not add
`sindresorhus/LaunchAtLogin`: that repository now redirects to `LaunchAtLogin-Legacy`
and is archived (last release v5.0.2, 2024-06-25), so it fails the checklist's
Continuity item outright. Its successor,
[LaunchAtLogin-Modern](https://github.com/sindresorhus/LaunchAtLogin-Modern) (MIT,
v1.1.0 released 2023-12-21, floor `.macOS(.v13)`), is a few lines around that same
call and fails the Need item instead — Foundation and one system framework already do
the job.

**A human-editable config file.** `Codable` plus `JSONEncoder`/`JSONDecoder` from
Foundation covers it: set `outputFormatting` to `[.prettyPrinted, .sortedKeys]` so the
file diffs cleanly, decode into a Core value type, and let a `MyAppPlatform` adapter
own the path under `~/Library/Application Support`. A package is worth it when the file
is a contract with the user rather than an implementation detail — when they are
expected to edit it by hand and want comments and trailing commas, which JSON has
neither of. That format is TOML.

- [TOMLDecoder](https://github.com/dduan/TOMLDecoder) — passes: MIT; 0.4.5 released
  2026-07-11; not archived; floor `.macOS(.v10_15)`; a pure-Swift library target with
  no binary target, and no package dependency in the default configuration (its
  benchmark, docs, and formatting dependencies sit behind `TOMLDECODER_*` environment
  opt-ins). It decodes only — rendering the file back out is yours to write, which
  usually fits, since the app writes a commented default once and the user owns it
  afterwards.
- [TOMLKit](https://github.com/LebJe/TOMLKit) reads *and* writes, but did not pass as
  checked: its manifest appends `apple/swift-docc-plugin` unconditionally, and a build
  plugin is build-time code the checklist routes to explicit human approval. Its latest
  release, 0.6.0, is also from 2024-01-03, with the last commit 2025-01-18. It wraps
  the toml++ C++ sources in a `CTOML` source target — that is not a binary target, so
  that item is fine; the build plugin and the release age are what stop it.

**Settings window.** Nothing is vetted here, and that is the finding rather than a gap
to fill later. SwiftUI's `Settings` scene (macOS 11+) already gives the ⌘, item, the
standard window, and its own scene phase; put a `TabView` in it, keep the state in a
Core view model, and persist it through a port exactly as above.
[Settings](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Settings) was checked and would pass on
license and shape (MIT, floor `.macOS(.v10_13)`, one resource-bearing target, no binary
target or build plugin), but its latest release, 3.1.1, is from 2024-05-07, and what it
buys is a toolbar-tab preferences window that the `Settings` scene now gives for free.
Add it only if you need that exact pre-Ventura look.

Before adding any dependency, apply the checklist in `.claude/rules/project.md`
(maintenance, license, transitive weight) and commit `Package.resolved` with it.
