# The one lint command: `just lint`, the pre-commit hook, and CI's lint job all call it.
#
#   scripts/lint.sh                      lint the whole repository
#   scripts/lint.sh --staged-tree DIR    lint only the Swift files exported into DIR
#
# Whole repository: swiftformat --lint, swiftlint --strict, shellcheck over every
# tracked shell script, actionlint, and typos. --staged-tree: swiftformat and
# swiftlint only, against DIR. Every check runs even if an earlier one fails; the
# script exits 1 if any failed.
#
# Tools are called by bare name, never through `mise exec --`: that would
# auto-install every tool in mise.toml, including the macOS-only ones CI's Linux
# lint job deliberately skips. The caller puts the tools on PATH — locally
# `mise exec -- scripts/lint.sh` (what `just lint` runs), in CI jdx/mise-action.
#
# Git work tree: the whole-repository mode enumerates tracked files, so it refuses
# to run outside one (git's own error); --staged-tree does not need one.
#
# Errors (each followed by Expected:/Actual:/Next: lines, exit 1):
#   ERR_LINT_USAGE         unknown argument, or a --staged-tree DIR that does not exist
#   ERR_LINT_TOOL_MISSING  a tool this mode needs is not on PATH
