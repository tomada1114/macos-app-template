## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial template: XcodeGen-generated app shell over a local Swift package
  with a Core/UI split and a working counter placeholder
- Swift Testing suite with an enforced 80% line-coverage floor on `MyAppCore`
  (`scripts/coverage.sh`)
- XCUITest launch test and a Release-build smoke script (`scripts/smoke_launch.sh`)
- `scripts/bootstrap.sh` deterministic template initializer: renames `MyApp`
  and replaces every placeholder (`my-app`, `com.example`, `your-username`,
  `Your Name`, `you@example.com`) across tracked files
- Strict tooling from day one: Swift 6 language mode, warnings-as-errors,
  SwiftLint strict with all opt-in rules, SwiftFormat, pinned via mise
- Hardened CI: SHA-pinned actions, least-privilege permissions, zizmor,
  typos, OpenSSF Scorecard, Dependabot with cooldown, OSV scan,
  dependency review, and a template bootstrap smoke job
- Secret-gated release pipeline: DMG packaging, Developer ID signing,
  notarization, and build-provenance attestation
- `CLAUDE.md` and path-scoped `.claude/rules/` for AI-assisted development
- ShellCheck joins the lint gate (`just lint` and CI) for every repo shell script
- The launch UI test writes an `.xcresult` bundle; CI uploads it when the job fails
- The release pipeline smoke-tests the signed Release app before packaging the DMG

### Changed

- `just build` and `just uitest` isolate DerivedData under `build/`, so
  `just clean` now removes everything the toolchain produced
